# Vikings Analytics

Analyzing Minnesota Vikings play-by-play data to answer real football questions with data.

## The Questions

*To be refined as I explore the data, but starting points:*

- How aggressive are the Vikings on 4th down compared to what the math says they should do?
- Where does the offense break down in the red zone?
- How do key receivers perform in different game situations (ahead, behind, close games)?

## Data Source

Play-by-play data from [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data) via the `nfl_data_py` Python package. Every play from every NFL game, ~400 columns of detail.
