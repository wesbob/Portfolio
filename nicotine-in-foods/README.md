# Nicotine in Foods

How much nicotine are you actually eating?

Nightshade vegetables - tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers - contain naturally occurring nicotine. Most people have no idea. This project pulls together research data and nutritional information to model what real dietary nicotine exposure looks like and puts it in context against a cigarette.

## The Question

> If you eat a normal diet with tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, how does your daily nicotine intake from food compare to smoking a cigarette?

## Data Sources

- **USDA FoodData Central API** - Nutritional profiles for nightshade vegetables
- **Published research** - Peer-reviewed studies measuring nicotine concentrations in common foods
- **WHO/FDA reference data** - Nicotine content and absorption rates from tobacco products

## Status

**Phase 1: Research & Data Collection** - Up next

## Phases

1. **Research & data collection** - Gather nicotine concentration data from studies, pull USDA nutritional data
2. **Build the dataset** - Combine sources into a clean, structured dataset
3. **Model exposure** - Calculate intake from common meals and daily diets
4. **Visualization** - Make the comparisons visual and intuitive
5. **Writeup** - Document methodology and findings here
