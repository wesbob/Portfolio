Data projects by Wes Brown. Business systems analyst with a habit of digging deeper than the job description asks for.

## Projects

### [Vikings Analytics](vikings-analytics/)
Play-by-play analysis of Minnesota Vikings games using nflverse data. Asking real football questions and answering them with SQL and Python.

### [Nicotine in Foods](nicotine-in-foods/)
How much nicotine are you eating? Nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant) contain naturally occurring nicotine. This project models actual dietary exposure and puts it in perspective.
